# 🔒 Firewall Policy Optimization Tool – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The **Firewall Policy Optimization Tool** is a self-hosted application built for cybersecurity professionals managing Palo Alto firewall configurations. Its primary goal is to analyze local configuration files, identify inefficiencies such as redundant, shadowed, unused, or overlapping rules, and provide clear, actionable recommendations—without transmitting or storing any sensitive data. The tool empowers teams to optimize rule bases, reduce complexity, and enhance security posture while maintaining full control of their environments.

## 2. Product Overview & Vision

### Vision

To become the go-to, privacy-first solution for firewall policy optimization—empowering security teams to audit and streamline Palo Alto firewall configurations with confidence and precision.

### Product Summary

The tool performs local analysis of Palo Alto firewall rule sets and objects to identify inefficiencies and provide recommendations. It targets technical users in security-conscious environments, especially where SaaS tools are not viable due to privacy or compliance concerns.

## 4. User Stories & Use Cases

### User Stories

* As a security engineer, I want to **upload a Palo Alto config file** so I can analyze the rule set without exposing sensitive data.
* As a consultant, I want to **generate a PDF report** with findings and recommendations so I can present it to clients.
* As a team lead, I want to **review unused and shadowed rules** so we can safely clean up our policy.

### Primary Use Cases

1. **Offline Rulebase Audit**: User runs the tool locally, uploads a config, and receives a categorized list of issues.
2. **Compliance Review Prep**: Generates exportable reports that help justify rule changes or cleanup actions.
3. **Policy Migration Support**: Helps identify redundant/unused elements before migrating to a new firewall.

  * Identify shadowed rules (order and scope)
  * Find unused rules (with optional log data)
  * Highlight overlapping rules
* **Object Analysis**:

  * Identify unused address/service objects
  * Detect redundant object definitions
* **Recommendation Generator**:

  * Clear, actionable optimization suggestions
* **Exportable Reports**:

  * PDF, CSV, and JSON report formats
* **Privacy-First Architecture**:

  * Entirely local processing, no data sent to external servers

### 💡 Nice-to-Have Features (Future Consideration)

* **Rule Comparison/Diff Tool**:

  * Compare two configuration versions
* **Visualization UI**:

  * Interactive charts/tables showing rule flows and overlaps
* **Historical Tracking**:

  * Allow users to track changes across different audit runs
* **Integration Hooks**:

  * CLI output for CI pipelines
* **Custom Rule Tagging**:

  * Tag rules (e.g., “Legacy,” “Audit Passed”) for internal use
