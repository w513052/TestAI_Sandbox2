The feature to break down is the **Core Feature: Local Rule Set Parsing** from the Firewall Policy Optimization Tool, as described in the provided documents (ProjectBriefDoc.txt, AIDesign.txt, Backend.txt, etc.). This feature involves ingesting and parsing Palo Alto firewall configuration files locally to extract rules, objects, and metadata for further analysis. Below, I’ll first break down the feature into logical steps, then provide a detailed markdown list of 1-story-point tasks that an AI coding agent can implement.

## 🎉 MAJOR PROGRESS UPDATE - Analysis Pipeline Fixes Completed

### Logical Steps for Local Rule Set Parsing

The Local Rule Set Parsing feature involves uploading a Palo Alto firewall configuration file (XML or set format), parsing its contents locally, and storing the extracted data (rules, objects, metadata) in a database for subsequent analysis. The logical steps to implement this feature are:

1. **File Upload Handling**:
   - Create an endpoint to accept file uploads via a POST request.
   - Validate the uploaded file format (XML or set format).
   - Compute a file hash to ensure integrity.

2. **XML Parsing Logic**:
   - Parse the XML configuration file to extract rules, address/service objects, and metadata (e.g., firmware version, rule count).
   - Handle malformed XML files gracefully with appropriate error messages.
   - Extract relevant rule attributes (e.g., rule name, source/destination zones, addresses, services, action, position).

3. **Set Format Parsing Logic**:
   - Parse the set-format configuration (text-based commands) to extract similar data as the XML parser.
   - Convert set commands into a structured format for consistency with XML parsing output.

4. **Data Storage**:
   - Store the parsed audit session metadata (e.g., session name, filename, file hash, start time) in the `AuditSession` table.
   - Save parsed rules in the `FirewallRule` table with attributes like rule name, type, source/destination, etc.
   - Save parsed address/service objects in the `ObjectDefinition` table.

5. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Implement error handling for invalid file formats, parsing errors, or database issues.
   - Log all actions (file upload, parsing success/failure) to a local log file for debugging.

6. **Integration with Frontend**:
   - Ensure the backend API returns a response compatible with the frontend (e.g., audit ID, session metadata).
   - Provide feedback to the frontend for successful parsing or errors.

7. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use streaming XML parsing to handle large configuration files efficiently.
   - Optimize database writes for large rule sets using batch operations.

8. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Write unit tests for XML and set-format parsing.
   - Test with sample Palo Alto configuration files from different firmware versions.
   - Validate database storage and API responses.

### Detailed Markdown List of 1-Story-Point Tasks

Below is a detailed markdown list of 1-story-point tasks for implementing the Local Rule Set Parsing feature. Each task is designed to be a small, self-contained unit of work that an AI coding agent can complete independently, with clear instructions and references to the provided documents.
